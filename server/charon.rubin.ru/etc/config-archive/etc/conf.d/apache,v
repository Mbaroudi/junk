# Config file for /etc/init.d/apache

# Here's an example using mod_ssl:
#
# <IfDefine SSL>
#    LoadModule ssl_module    extramodules/libssl.so
# </IfDefine>
#
# This means that libssl.so is only loaded into the server when you
# pass "-D SSL" to it at startup.
#
# Anything else in apache.conf which is guarded similarly, like:
#
# <IfDefine FOO> ... </IfDefine>
#
# can be easily turned on/off by editing APACHE_OPTS below to
# include or to not include "-D FOO".
#
# If you installed mod_throttle, you can add "-D THROTTLE"; if you
# installed mod_dav, then add "-D DAV".  For mod_gzip use "-D GZIP".
# The mod_contribs package has several options you can use.  See
# your apache.conf file for more details.
APACHE_OPTS="-D SSL -D PHP4"

# Extended options for advanced uses of Apache ONLY
# You don't need to edit these unless you are doing crazy Apache stuff
# As not having them set correctly, or feeding in an incorrect configuration
# via them will result in Apache failing to start
# YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED.

# ServerRoot setting
#SERVERROOT=/usr/lib/apache

# Configuration file location
# - If this does NOT start with a '/', then it is treated relative to
# $SERVERROOT by Apache
#CONFIGFILE=/etc/apache/httpd.conf

# Location of Pidfile. Remember to change this in httpd.conf too!
#PIDFILE=/var/run/apache.pid

# Environment variables to keep
# All environment variables are cleared from apache
# Use this to preserve some of them
# NOTE!!! It's very important that this contains PATH
# Also, it will fail if the _value_ for any of these variables contains a space
