# Sample NRPE Config File 
# Written by: Ethan Galstad (nagios@@nagios.org)
# 
# Last Modified: 12-30-2002
#
# NOTES:
# This is a sample configuration file for the NRPE daemon.  It needs to be
# located on the remote host that is running the NRPE daemon, not the host
# from which the check_nrpe client is being executed.
#############################################################################



# PORT NUMBER
# Port number we should wait for connections on.
# NOTE: This must be a non-priviledged port (i.e. > 1024).
# NOTE: This option is ignored if NRPE is running under either inetd or xinetd

server_port=5666



# SERVER ADDRESS
# Address that nrpe should bind to in case there are more than one interface
# and you do not want nrpe to bind on all interfaces.
# NOTE: This option is ignored if NRPE is running under either inetd or xinetd

#server_address=192.168.1.1



# ALLOWED HOST ADDRESSES
# This is a comma-delimited list of IP address of hosts that are allowed
# to talk to the NRPE daemon.
#
# NOTE: The daemon only does rudimentary checking of the client's IP
#       address.  I would highly recommend adding entries in your
#	/etc/hosts.allow file to allow only the specified host to connect
#	to the port you are running this daemon on.
#
# NOTE: This option is ignored if NRPE is running under either inetd or xinetd

allowed_hosts=127.0.0.1



# NRPE USER
# This determines the effective user that the NRPE daemon should run as.  
# You can either supply a username or a UID.
# 
# NOTE: This option is ignored if NRPE is running under either inetd or xinetd

nrpe_user=nagios



# NRPE GROUP
# This determines the effective group that the NRPE daemon should run as.  
# You can either supply a group name or a GID.
# 
# NOTE: This option is ignored if NRPE is running under either inetd or xinetd

nrpe_group=nagios



# DEBUGGING OPTION
# This option determines whether or not debugging messages are logged to the
# syslog facility.
# Values: 0=debugging off, 1=debugging on

debug=0



# COMMAND TIMEOUT
# This specifies the maximum number of seconds that the NRPE daemon will
# allow plugins to finish executing before killing them off.

command_timeout=60



# COMMAND DEFINITIONS
# Command definitions that this daemon will run.  Definitions
# are in the following format:
#
# command[<command_name>]=<command_line>
#
# When the daemon receives a request to return the results of <command_name>
# it will execute the command specified by the <command_line> argument.
#
# Unlike Nagios, the command line cannot contain macros - it must be
# typed exactly as it should be executed.
#
# Note: Any plugins that are used in the command lines must reside
# on the machine that this daemon is running on!  The examples below
# assume that you have plugins installed in a /usr/nagios/libexec
# directory.  Also note that you will have to modify the definitions below
# to match the argument format the plugins expect.  Remember, these are
# examples only!

command[check_users]=/usr/nagios/libexec/check_users -w 5 -c 10
command[check_load]=/usr/nagios/libexec/check_load -w 15,10,5 -c 30,25,20
command[check_disk1]=/usr/nagios/libexec/check_disk -w 20 -c 10 -p /dev/hda1
command[check_disk2]=/usr/nagios/libexec/check_disk -w 20 -c 10 -p /dev/hdb1
command[check_zombie_procs]=/usr/nagios/libexec/check_procs -w 5 -c 10 -s Z
command[check_total_procs]=/usr/nagios/libexec/check_procs -w 150 -c 200

# COMMAND ARGUMENT PROCESSING
# This option determines whether or not the NRPE daemon will allow clients
# to specify arguments to commands that are executed.  This option only works
# if the daemon was configured with the --enable-command-args configure script
# option.  
#
# *** ENABLING THIS OPTION IS A SECURITY RISK! *** 
# Read the SECURITY file for information on some of the security implications
# of enabling this variable.
