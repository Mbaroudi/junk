# IMPORTANT:
#
# You MUST set $PVR before source'ing this file.  This is automatically
# taken care of for ebuilds ... other scripts must remember to do this too!
#
# The SAME warning goes for setting $PN.
#
# See ebuild(5) for details on what $PN and $PVR are for.

# USER-EDITABLE SETTINGS
#
# Feel free to edit these settings to suit your local needs
#
# ========================================================================

# VHOST_ROOT is the directory where virtual host websites are added
# so, if your server is hosting (say)
#
# 	www.gentoo.org
#	bugs.gentoo.org
#
# then the htdocs directory for each of these would be
#
#	/var/www/www.gentoo.org/htdocs
#	/var/www/bugs.gentoo.org/htdocs
#
# Change this setting *only* if you need your websites installed in
# a different physical location
#
# If you perfer to use Gentoo's optional support for the /srv service
# home file hierarchy, uncomment the second version of VHOST_ROOT
# (this should have been done for you if you installed webapp-config
# with the srvdir USE flag enabled)

VHOST_ROOT="/var/www/${G_HOSTNAME}"
#VHOST_ROOT="/srv/${G_HOSTNAME}/www"

# some web applications need to know what host they are serving up pages
# for.  this information is configured when the application is installed
# by the webapp-config script
#
# changing this value *after* the application has been installed has
# no effect!!
#
# you can override this setting by using the -h switch to webapp-config

VHOST_HOSTNAME="localhost"
# VHOST_HOSTNAME="`hostname --fqdn 2>/dev/null || echo localhost`"

# what web server are you using?
# your choices are:
#
# apache-basic
#
# you can override this setting by using the -s switch to webapp-config

VHOST_SERVER="apache"

# which user should own config files?
# the default is 'id -nu', which is normally the root user
#
# IMPORTANT: never set this to a numerial uid.  always use the username
# or else webapp-config *will* complain that the user does not exist
#
# you can override this setting by using the -u switch to webapp-config

VHOST_CONFIG_UID="`id -nu`"

# which group should own config files?
# the default is 'id -ng', which is normally the root group
#
# IMPORTANT: never set this to a numerical gid.  always use the group name
# or else webapp-config *will* complain that the group does not exist
#
# you can override this setting by using the -g switch to webapp-config

VHOST_CONFIG_GID="`id -ng`"

# what type of shared directories should be created?
# the default is 'virtual', which means that each install of the app
# does NOT get a unique copy of the directory, or the files beneath it
#
# permitted values are: server-owned, config-owned, virtual, root-owned
#
# you can override this setting by using the --virtual-dirs switch to
# webapp-config

VHOST_CONFIG_VIRTUAL_DIRS="virtual"

# what type of shared files should be created?
# the default is 'virtual', which means that each install of the app
# does NOT get a unique copy of the files
#
# permitted values are: server-owned, config-owned, virtual
#
# you can override this setting by using the --virtual-files switch to
# webapp-config

VHOST_CONFIG_VIRTUAL_FILES="virtual"

# where should drop-in config files for Apache et al go?
#
# these files will be called <server>-<app>.conf.  They are quite rare,
# but are needed from time to time by the odd application or two

VHOST_CONFIG_DIR="${VHOST_ROOT}/conf"

# which user & group should own the files by default?
#
# the default is for files to be owned by the superuser root, so that
# they cannot be tampered with by other users
#
# this setting affects the files and directories installed by the ebuild,
# and it affects some directories created by webapp-config.  It does not
# affect any of the files installed by webapp-config at this time.

VHOST_DEFAULT_UID="root"
VHOST_DEFAULT_GID="root"

# what type of links do you want to use?
#
# starting with webapp-config v1.10, the default behaviour is to attempt
# to hardlink a file from /usr/share/webapps/* first.  If the hardlink
# fails (normally because /usr and /var | /srv are on different filesystems)
# webapp-config will fall back to making a physical copy of the file
# instead
#
# NOTE:
#	we have moved to hardlinks because not all web-based packages work
#	when their files are symlinked in
#
#	please do not raise bugs about packages that do not work when
#	symlinked
#
# VHOST_LINK_TYPE="soft"

# what are the names of your document directories?
#
# by default, your website lives in /var/www/<hostname>/htdocs.  If you
# run webapp-config with the --secure switch, your website instead lives
# in /var/www/<hostname>/htdocs-secure.
#
# you can change the default names of 'htdocs' and 'htdocs-secure' by
# editing these two variables

VHOST_HTDOCS_INSECURE="htdocs"
VHOST_HTDOCS_SECURE="htdocs-secure"

# what permissions do you want the files to have?
#
# by default, webapp-config installs directories and files with these
# permissions.  You can change them here to comply with your local
# security policies.

# EDIT THE VARIABLES BELOW THIS LINE AT YOUR OWN RISK
#
# These variables are used by the webapp.eclass component of Portage,
# and by /usr/sbin/webapp-config.
#
# If you break your Gentoo installation by changing these settings, then
# re-emerge the webapps-config package to restore the default values
#
# When webapp-config is upgraded, it may add to and/or change the value of
# variables listed here.  If you do not merge in these changes, you will
# probably find that webapp-config will break in horrible ways.
#
# etc-update is NOT optional ;-)

# which version of webapp-config is this file for?
#
# we have a problem when users upgrade webapp-config.  It turns out that
# they don't explicitly upgrade webapp-config ... instead, webapp-config
# gets because it is a dependency for a web-based package.
#
# unfortunately, this means that any changes to this config file do not
# get installed (through etc-update or equivalent) until after the web-
# based package has been installed.  We end up trying to install the
# package using a partial install of webapp-config
#
# how can we work around this?
#
# the only way to work around this is to put some sort of version-control
# marker in this config file.  webapp-config and this file must agree on
# what this marker is, otherwise webapp-config will refuse to work
