Typical Classification Methods:

\item Support Vector Machines
\item Decision Tree
\item Neural Network
\item Bayesian Network

\subsection{Pattern-based classification methods}
\begin{itemize}\item CBA [Liu, Hsu \& Ma, KDD’98]: Use high-conf., high-support class association rules to build classifiers\item Emerging patterns [Dong \& Li, KDD’99]: Patterns whose support changes significantly between the two classes\item CMAR [Li, Han \& Pei, ICDM’01]: Multiple rules in prediction\item CPAR [Yin \& Han, SDM’03]: Beam search on multiple prediction rules\item RCBT [Cong et al., SIGMOD’05]: Build classifier based on mining top-k covering rule groups with row enumeration (for high-dimensional data)\item Lazy classifier [Veloso, Meira \& Zaki, ICDM’06]: For a test t, project training data D on t, mine rules from $D_t$ , predict on the best rule\item Discriminative pattern-based classification [Cheng et al., ICDE’07]
\end{itemize}

\subsection{CBA: Classification Based on Associations}
\begin{itemize}\item Mine high-confidence, high-support class association rules\item LHS: conjunctions of attribute-value pairs); RHS: class labels\\$p_1 \wedge p_2 ... \wedge p_l \to \left[A_{class-label} = C\right]$\item Rank rules in descending order of confidence and support\item Classification: Apply the first rule that matches a test case; otherwise apply the default rule
\end{itemize}

\subsection{CMAR: Classification Based on Multiple Association Rules}
Rule pruning whenever a rule is inserted into the tree:
\begin{itemize}
\item Given two rules, $R_1$ and $R_2$, if the antecedent\footnote{Antecedent - предшественник} of $R_1$ is more general than that of $R_2$ and $conf(R_1) \geqslant conf(R_2)$, then prune $R_2$\item Prunes rules for which the rule antecedent and class label are not positively correlated, based on the $\chi^2$ test of statistical significance
\end{itemize}

Classification based on generated/pruned rules:
\begin{itemize}
\item If only one rule satisfies tuple X, assign the class label of the rule \item If a ruleset S satisfies X
\begin{itemize}\item Divide S into groups according to class labels\item Use a weighted $\chi^2$ measure to find the strongest group of rules, based on the statistical correlation of rules within a group 
\item Assign X the class label of the strongest group
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Discriminative Pattern-Based Classification}
\textbf{Principle:} Mining discriminative frequent patterns as high-qualityfeatures and then apply any classifier.

Framework (\textbf{PatClass}):
\begin{itemize}\item Feature construction by \textbf{frequent itemset mining}\item Feature selection (e.g., using \textbf{Maximal Marginal Relevance (MMR)})
\begin{itemize}\item Select \textbf{discriminative features} (i.e., that are relevant but minimally similar to the previously selected ones)\item Remove redundant or closely correlated features 
\end{itemize}
\item Model learning: apply a general classifier, such as SVM or C4.5, to build a classification model
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{On the Power of Discriminative Patterns}
K-itemsets are often more informative than single features (1-itemsets) in classification. Computation on real datasets shows: the discriminative power of k-itemsets (for $k > 1$ but often $\leqslant 10$) is higher than that of single features.\\

Computation on real datasets shows: pattern frequency (but not too frequent) is strongly tied with the discriminative power (information gain). Information gain upper bound monotonically increases with pattern frequency.

\caption{Information Gain}\label{fig:ig}\end{figure}

Information gain formula:
\begin{gather*}
IG (C \mid X) = H (C) - H (C \mid X)\text{, where }\\
H(C) = -\sum^{m}_{i=1}p_i \log_2(p_i)\text{ - entropy of given data}\\
H(C \mid X) = \sum_j P(X=x_j) H(Y \mid X=x_j)\text{ - conditional entropy of study focus}
\end{gather*}

\subsection{DDPMine: Direct Mining of Discriminative Patterns}
General methodology:
\begin{itemize}\item Input: A set of training instances D and a set of features F\item Iteratively perform feature selection based on the \textbf{<<sequential coverage>>} paradigm
\begin{itemize}\item Select the feature fi with the highest discriminative power\item Remove instances Di from D covered by the selected feature fi
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

Implementation:
\begin{itemize}\item Integration of \textbf{branch-and-bound search} with FP-growth mining\item Iteratively eliminate training instances and \textbf{progressively shrink the FP-tree}
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Branch-and-Bound Search}
\begin{itemize}
\item The discriminative power (information gain) of a low frequency pattern is upper bounded by a small value\item During FPGrowth mining we record the most discriminative itemset discovered so far and its information gain value $g_{best}$
\begin{itemize}\item Before constructing a conditional FP-tree, we first estimate the upper bound of information gain based on the conditional DB\item If the upper bound value $\leqslant g_{best}$, skip this conditional FP-tree and its subsequent trees
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
